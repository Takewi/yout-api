# yout-api

This project needs nodejs (Only to run dev and create the exe build), if you going to use a build, don't need this dependencie.

## installing dependencies

```bash
yarn install
or
npm install
```

## Run project

```bash
yarn dev
or
npm run dev
```

## To create a .exe file you need nexe

Nexe needs python, i recommend any recent version of python.
To basic exe build of this project you can run:

```bash
yarn build
```

See package file to see the build script.
I personally recommend you look for the documentation on nexe if you want to make an executable of this project for your own use.
